**DEPRECATED**

PlexKit
=======
A bunch of often used utility functions/classes.

It isn't that much at the moment, but it will hopefully grow overtime.

One nice feature already is the RKTableViewSectionLocationDelegate, which allows UITableViewCell's to know their
own location within their section (Top, Middle, Bottom, Single), even while reordering, inserting or deleting.
